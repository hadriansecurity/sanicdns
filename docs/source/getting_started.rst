What is SanicDNS
----------------
SanicDNS is a tool that can resolve DNS requests blazingly fast, with the correct hardware and correct resolvers you can resolve up to 5.000.000 domain names each second. You provide a list with input domains and a list with resolvers, SanicDNS will take care of resolving these domains against the provided resolvers in the fastest way possible.

Quickstart
----------

For the quickstart, see the `Github readme <https://github.com/hadriansecurity/sanicdns>`_

NIC options
-----------

SanicDNS supports to different NIC options: AF_XDP and I40E. `Data Plane Development Kit <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Plane_Development_Kit>`_ is used as an abstraction layer over both network interface types. A schematic representation of the data flow of both options is visualised in the schematics below.

AF_XDP
======

SanicDNS's most easy to use operating mode is the AF_XDP operating mode. `AF_XDP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Express_Data_Path>`_ is a method for `userspace <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space_and_kernel_space>`_ applications to skip the Linux network stack altogether and send and receive packets as close to the network card as possible. A `BPF program <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter>`_ is loaded in the kernel and when a new packet is received by the kernel it is immediately forwarded to the userspace application when it matches the specified filter configuration. AF_XDP also allows userspace applications to forward packets directly into the NIC with as little intervention from the kernel as possible.

I40E
====

SanicDNS also supports linking I40E devices directly to the userspace application. Custom DPDK drivers are loaded on the PCI device, SanicDNS can bind to the NIC directly for maximum performance. The I40E driver supports 10/25/40 Gbps IntelÂ® Ethernet 700 Series Network Adapters based on the Intel Ethernet Controller X710/XL710/XXV710.

Although this mode provides by far the highest performance it is also quite cumbersome to use since it requires a specific network card and two physical ethernet links to the machine that is used: one for 'regular' traffic and one to the dedicated NIC for SanicDNS.

Tests with the XL710 NIC have shown that SanicDNS can produce 40Mpps in raw DNS request (40GbE line rate) and resolve around 7.5M requests per second (tested with our own DPDK-based resolver). Although these speeds are not too useful for real-world scenario's it's a good learning opportunity for checking out high-performance networking.
